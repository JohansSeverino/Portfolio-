             <p>My name is Johans Severino and I am 17 years old. I grew up in the bronx so I know both sides of the world. I currently attend The Highschool of Computers and Technology and work my hardest to make a better future for myself. I do this through the use of extracurricular programs and doing my own research on what i would like to do. 
             I aspire to one day be a business entrepreneur, psychologist and a writer. </p>
             <p>Along with NYOT I have other hobbies and extracarucliers some of which include
             <lu>
              <li> Reading </li>
              <li>Reaserching Business and the human mind</li>

        <h3>The Program</h3>
        <p>
         New York on Tech (NYOT) has been a true blessing not only for all of the opprtunities they have given me but because of 
         the new world they introduced me to. Throughout the span of the program i was able to learn many aspects of coding that i would've never thought went into it. Some of which include the use of sections and the style page.
         However the best part of this program was to see how my peers and I were able to learn this code and to realize how much of a head start we have compared to many other people. For that I believe and hope the program will continue to prosper, grow and teach other kids like me about this beautiful world that we call code.
        </p>
